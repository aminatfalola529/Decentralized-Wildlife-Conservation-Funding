# Decentralized Wildlife Conservation Funding System

A blockchain-based platform that transforms wildlife conservation funding through transparency, direct impact verification, and community engagement.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless ecosystem where conservation projects can receive direct funding, donors can track the impact of their contributions, and all stakeholders benefit from transparent reporting and verified outcomes. By removing traditional intermediaries and providing immutable records of both funding and impact, the platform revolutionizes how conservation initiatives are financed and measured.
